This compile_all_boards.sh script contained in this directory attempts to
compile the top-level template project in the Miosix repository for all the
supported boards listed in Makefile.inc.

This is useful to ensure that a change in common header/configuration files
does not break compilation on a different board than the one currently being
tested.

To use the script you must first remember to manually modify the
miosix/config/miosix_settings.h file to set the desired options.
Then you can run it from the script's directory or from any other directory of
your choice.
Regardless of where the current working directory is at invocation time, the
script will always move the build products to its directory (the one where this
README is also located).

To build Miosix for all boards, invoke the script with no options, i.e.:

  ./compile_all_boards.sh
  
To remove all existing build product, pass "clean" as the only option:

  ./compile_all_boards.sh clean

The files produced for each board are the following:

  [board name].elf            main.elf for that board
  [board name].bin            main.bin for that board
  [board name].asm            disassembly of main.elf (useful for diffing)
  [board name]_size.txt       output of `size` for main.elf
  [board name].log            verbose compilation output

If compilation fails for a given board, only the .log file will be available
and the script will proceed to the next one.
